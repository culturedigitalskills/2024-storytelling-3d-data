With the advent of HTML5, web browsers are fully ready to render 3D models 
without users needing to install any additional software or plugins. 

Many platforms for publishing and sharing 3D models have been made available, including some which are popular with cultural heritage content:

- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Kompakkt](https://kompakkt.de/explore?locale=en)
- [Morphosource](https://www.morphosource.org/)
- [Thingiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thingiverse)
- [Visual Media Service](https://visual.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/)

Most of these solutions use cloud technologies in which the 
3D models are stored on the servers of the organisation providing the software. 

Hence, they require the user to upload the 3D model and prepare it for viewing.

## Preparing 3D files 

Before publishing, there is a need to prepare the files for publications.

This involves ensuring all post-processing and visual enhancement are done,
and the model is ready to be uploaded online.


Normally, you will need to:

- Reduce the number of polygons to create a 
lightweight version of the model that is optimised 
for web publication. This can be done either in the software
which generated the 3D model, or using a software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/).

- Ensure the textures are saved with the 3D model.

- Save using a web-friendly format. Various tools will have
different requirements regarding formats. Normally, OBJ or glb/gltf
are widely accepted.
