# Digital Skills in Visual and Material Culture - General Guidelines for Instructors

## Background
These notes were produced as part of the A Roadmap for a National Training Centre on Multidimensional Digital Media in the Arts and Humanities” project (Grant No. AH/X007626/1) funded under the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council under the Embed digital skills in arts and humanities research scheme which aims to address the digital skills gap within the arts and humanities research community. 

Our pilot addresses the need to upskill researchers and other communities worldwide, including practitioners in the Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museum (GLAM), and creative industries, in the digitisation, processing, analysis, management, use and reuse of visual media. Interest in these activities is partly driven by the availability of devices, such as smartphones and web platforms to provide access to the content, as well as the potential of the data to support research, access, dissemination, and creative reuse. 

## Train the trainer
Our training material has been designed for you to learn these skills but also to empower you to pass the knowledge of methods and expertise on to others, who may then become trainers themselves. This framework, known as train the trainer, is the most scalable and sustainable method and to benefit as many communities as possible around the world. 

There are some important definitions we introduce in the following sections:

## Workshop and active learning
Our training material has also been designed to be delivered in a workshop format. By workshop, we understand an ideally face to face meeting (although it could also works online or hybrid for certain topics), where a group of people interested in the same problem engage in activities relevant to a particular subject or project. In our opinion, the face to face approach work best as it allows for an active learning approach and collaboration. 

In active learning, students are not passive in the learning process but engage in instructional activities which allow them to engage in higher-order thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation (Bonwell 1991). As such, our training material incorporates short lesson-related individual or small-group activities that you can ask students to do, alternating with instructor-led intervals in which student responses are processed and new information is presented.

## Lessons (Carpentries Style)
We follow a [Carpentries style](https://carpentries.org/) lesson format. The Carpentries is a global community teaching foundational computational and data science skills to researchers in academia, industry and government. They have a well-established model for delivering training, and although we do not currently offer our training within this organisation, we do make use of the Open Source Lessons tools as it allows us to create resources which are collaborative and can be built upon by yourself and others using open source tools. 
In Carpentries style, a Lesson is a learning activity which is made up of self-contained units (called Episodes) that contribute to the larger session. The typical length of an episode is about 20-60 minutes of content (teaching + exercises). 

Thus, to help you design a workshop, the lesson provides you with the information on how long it takes. You can then decide to organise a workshop in a morning, afternoon or evening session which covers one Lesson, or put together a two or three-day workshop which includes various Lessons. By allowing more time, it gives learners the time to processes what they have learned before and also helps building the community of practice.

## Space for learning

As a workshop trainer, remember you are not in the traditional role of the teacher. You might feel you don’t have all the knowledge to answer all possible questions from participants as you are also in a learning journey. Active learning allows for collaborative learning, and, hence, we suggest you look for spaces which suit this modality for learning. Avoid having a “theatre” style sit arrangements, where all students face the teacher. Prefer instead, tables that bring together small groups of people, or a round table where everyone face each other. This will create a more equal environment.

With this in mind, resist the urge to explain too much and allow time for people to participate, ask questions and share their points of view. Similarly, when you ask questions and none of the participants replies immediately, don’t panic. Reflective silence is an important aspect of learning as it allow participants to process what they have heard and apply it to their own situation and needs.
