## Digital Skills in Visual and Material Culture - General Guidelines for Instructors

### Background
These notes were produced as part of the [A Roadmap for a National Training Centre on Multidimensional Digital Media in the Arts and Humanities‚Äù project](https://culturedigitalskills.org/) (Grant No. AH/X007626/1) funded under the [UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/) under the Embed digital skills in arts and humanities research scheme, which aims to address the digital skills gap within the arts and humanities research community. 

Our pilot addresses the need to upskill researchers and other communities worldwide, including practitioners in the Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museum (GLAM), and creative industries, in the digitisation, processing, analysis, management, use and reuse of visual media. Interest in these activities is partly driven by the availability of devices, such as smartphones and web platforms to provide access to the content, as well as the potential of the data to support research, access, dissemination, and creative reuse.
