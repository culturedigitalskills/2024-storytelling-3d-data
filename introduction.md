:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why 3D data needs to be made accessible.
- What does FAIR data means.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Making it FAIR

Once a 3D model is created by deploying digitisation methods,
it is good practice to provide access to the 3D model.

It is also useful to follow the FAIR principles, which states 
that content should remain:

- **Findable**: creating rich and structured metadata for your 3D model will potentially allow others to find the 3D model, and the information related to it.
- **Accessible**: the 3D model and its metadata should be
accessible via using a *protocol* for web, such as HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Interoperable**: consider how other users will bring together content
from various data sets, for instance to create a new project. Some frameworks such as [IIIF](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif) (generally pronounced "triple-eye-eff") allow for linking to visual media in an interoperable way.
- **Reusable**: 3D data should be 
released with a clear and accessible data usage license.


## Storytelling 

Storytelling is 
a useful way to engage users not only with the 3D model. But
also with other stories which 
bring to life the significance of such object
when documenting material knowledge.

Although the domain of storytelling is large,
we mostly cover the stories which are
easily enabled by accessible web tools.

We refer to this type of content as **interactive
linear stories**, to distinguish them
from potentially other non-linear and non-interactive 
ways in which stories
can be created to engage with 3D content.

Can you think other types of digital content
with rely heavily in 3D models?

In which ways are these interactive/non-interactive,
or linear/non-linear.

In this type of stories,
user can interact with the 3D model
by following a sequential narrative.
This type of storytelling
is popular in museums' applications, such as kiosks.

Websites also use the popular **scrollytelling** technique.
This technique allows a user to follow a narrative by scrolling.
By doing this, they access an interwoven mix of textual and visual
media, including images, videos or 3D models, with which they can
interact to get additional details.

## Annotations
Images and 3D models also use a technique called annotations,
where more informaiton can be *pinned* to the asset
at a specific position. This technique is heavily used when
interacting with the 3D model
to the attention of users particular positions of the
3D model which are of interest.
