:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why 3D data needs to be made accessible.
- What does FAIR data means.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Making it FAIR

Once a 3D model is created by deploying digitisation methods,
it is good practice to provide access to the 3D model.

It is also useful to follow the FAIR principles, which states 
that content should remain:

- **Findable**: allow others to find the 3D model and the information related to it.
- **Accessible**: the 3D model and its metadata should be
accessible via using a *protocol* for web, such as HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Interoperable**: consider how other users will bring together content
from various data sets, for instance to create a new project. Some frameworks such as [IIIF](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif) (generally pronounced "triple-eye-eff") allow for linking to visual media in an interoperable way.
- **Reusable**: 3D data should be 
released with a clear and accessible data usage license.


## Interactive Linear Stories 

Storytelling is a useful way to engage users 
with object and their 
stories. Storytelling is large domain,
we focus on the stories which are
easily enabled by accessible web-tools.

**Interactive linear stories** allow 
users to interact with the 3D models
by following a sequential narrative.
This type of storytelling
is popular in museums' applications, such as kiosks.

Images and 3D models also use a technique called annotations,
where more information can be *pinned* to the asset
at a specific position. This technique is heavily used when
interacting with the 3D model
to the attention of users particular positions of the
3D model which are of interest.

## Scrollytelling

Websites also use the popular **scrollytelling** technique, which 
allows a user to follow a 
narrative by scrolling.

By doing this, they access an interwoven mix of textual and visual
media, including images, videos or 3D models, with which they can
interact to get additional details.

::::: challenge

Can you think other types of digital content
with rely heavily in 3D models?

In which ways are these interactive/non-interactive,
or linear/non-linear.
