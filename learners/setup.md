title: Setup

## Data Sets
Data will be produced during the workshop,
so you will mostly need access to a web browser and some space in your
computer to store the data.
<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->

## Software Setup

For this tutorial, you will need access to the web-based [Exhibit tool](https://exhibit-culturedigitalskills.vercel.app/) and [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/).

You will also need access to any 3D models you have produced
during the workshop. 
If you do not have access to data, you can use 3D
models from this dataset:

- [Larger sculpture](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_S1Z0U2srVkVqRHI5RVBETFZsVVhFcTh0U2xvc1p2MUM1T1d0d2Y4Y2VXNzZTVytsQnRDTjlxWXJMNm1FVkpEWQ==)

The tutorial is built with [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/), as part of the training activities of the [AHRC-funded network service on Digital Skills in Visual and Material Culture](https://www.culturedigitalskills.org).
