## Data Sets
You can use already existing data (see below) or data which have been produced during a training workshop or  data produced by making use of the rest of our resources. You will also need access to a web browser and some space in your
computer to store the data.
<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->

## Software Setup

For this tutorial, you will need access to the web-based [Exhibit tool](https://exhibit-culturedigitalskills.vercel.app/) and [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/).

You will also need access to existing 3D models or any 3D models you have produced
during the workshop. 
If you do not have access to data, you can use 3D
models from this dataset:
