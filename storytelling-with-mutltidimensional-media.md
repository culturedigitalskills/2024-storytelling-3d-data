Specialised tools, such as [Exhibit](https://www.exhibit.so/), allow to easily 
curate a story bringing together multidimensional 
media, including 3D, images and video. It is IIIF compatible leveraging its
interoperability to bring together various conten.

For example, the example below shows the story of the 
Kinora, which was an 
early motion picture device developed by the French inventors Auguste 
and Louis Lumière in 1895. 

As you will notice, the story brings together images, videos
and 3D models to illustrate the
history of these artefacts, their context and mechanics. The media 
with which this story as developed is available [here](https://data.d4science.org/workspace-explorer-app?folderId=MUVkZVY5L1hRYnV4ZzJiUVljVlk5U1hmOHZYaDQ1SGVZT0l6aUZGa2lEclVFT0ppWEo4VDRzU2Z0alNiSk5GTg).

## Developing a 3D story in Exhibit

We will learn to use the tutorial [Exhibit tool](https://exhibit-culturedigitalskills.vercel.app/) to give access
to a 3D model.

Please register to use the tool.

Using the 3D model
which you previously created, the task is 
to create a story which brings all of this together. You can upload files for images and 3D models directly in the
[Exhibit tool](https://exhibit-culturedigitalskills.vercel.app/).
